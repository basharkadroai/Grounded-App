## 🎯 My Recommendation

### For Seeing Real iOS Design:
**Use iSwift.dev** - Preview each screen individually
- Takes 15 minutes to see all screens
- Shows actual iOS styling
- No barriers, completely free

### For Testing Functionality:
**Use Web Demo** - Test complete app flow
- Already built and ready
- Full navigation works
- Just doesn't look as pretty

### Best Approach:
1. **First:** Use iSwift.dev to see Home Screen (2 min)
2. **Then:** Use Web Demo to test functionality (5 min)
3. **Finally:** Use iSwift.dev to preview other screens you're curious about

This way you see both the beautiful design AND test the full functionality!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### iSwift.dev not loading?
- Try different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Check internet connection
- Clear browser cache

### Code not rendering?
- Make sure you copied ALL the code
- Check for syntax errors
- Try the `Preview/HomeScreenPreview.swift` file first (it's self-contained)

### Want to see navigation?
- iSwift.dev can't show multi-screen navigation
- Use web demo for that
- Or use Appetize.io (needs setup)

## 📞 Questions?

**"Can I see the full app navigating between screens?"**
- Not on iSwift.dev (single screen only)

- Or use Appetize.io (needs Mac to build)

- Yes! iSwift.dev renders real SwiftUI
- Same fonts, colors, shadows, animations
- Only difference: can't navigate between screens

**"Is there ANY way to see full app for free without credit card?"**
- Only the web demo (but it looks basic)
- iSwift.dev shows real iOS but one screen at a time
- No service offers full iOS app preview without payment info

- Start with Home Screen
- Then 5-4-3-2-1 Exercise
