## New iOS App "Grounded" Launches to Help Millions Manage Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder

**First-of-its-kind mental health app provides evidence-based grounding techniques, habit tracking, and educational resources for DPDR sufferers**

[CITY, STATE] – [DATE] – Today marks the launch of Grounded, a groundbreaking iOS application designed specifically for individuals managing Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DPDR). Available now on the App Store, Grounded provides immediate access to clinically-informed grounding exercises, comprehensive habit tracking, and expert-reviewed educational resources.

### Addressing an Underserved Need

Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder affects approximately 2% of the global population—roughly 160 million people—yet remains one of the least understood and most isolating mental health conditions. People with DPDR experience persistent feelings of detachment from themselves or their surroundings, often describing it as "living in a dream" or "feeling disconnected from reality."

"DPDR is incredibly distressing, yet there have been few dedicated tools to help people manage symptoms in their daily lives," said [Your Name], creator of Grounded. "We built Grounded to fill that gap—providing immediate relief during episodes while also supporting long-term management through habit building and education."

### Evidence-Based Approach

Grounded offers four clinically-informed grounding exercises:

- **5-4-3-2-1 Technique**: Engages all five senses to anchor users in the present moment
- **Body Scan**: Progressive body awareness meditation
- **Breath Work**: 4-7-8 breathing technique with visual guidance
- **Sensory Grounding**: Deep focus on individual senses

Each exercise includes pre and post mood tracking, allowing users to see their improvement over time and identify which techniques work best for them.

### Comprehensive Management Tools

Beyond immediate relief, Grounded helps users build long-term resilience through:

- **Habit Tracking**: Monitor sleep, exercise, hydration, and other factors that influence DPDR symptoms
- **Educational Resources**: 30+ expert-reviewed articles covering understanding, coping, treatment, and recovery
- **Advanced Insights**: Pattern recognition and correlation analysis to identify triggers and effective strategies
- **Data Export**: Share progress with therapists and healthcare providers

### Privacy-First Design

"Privacy and safety were paramount in our design process," added [Your Name]. "All data is stored locally on the user's device, with optional encrypted iCloud sync. We never share personal information without explicit consent."

The app features a calming, minimalist interface specifically designed to be accessible during moments of distress, with no jarring animations or overwhelming elements.

### Freemium Model
