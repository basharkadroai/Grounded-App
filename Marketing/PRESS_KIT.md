# Grounded - Press Kit

## Overview

**Grounded** is a mental health iOS application designed specifically for individuals managing Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DPDR). Launched in 2026, Grounded provides evidence-based grounding techniques, habit tracking, and educational resources in a calming, accessible interface.

## The Problem

Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder affects approximately 2% of the population, yet remains one of the least understood mental health conditions. People with DPDR experience persistent feelings of detachment from themselves or their surroundings, often describing it as "living in a dream" or "watching life from outside their body."

Despite its prevalence, there are few dedicated tools to help people manage DPDR symptoms in their daily lives.

Grounded fills this gap by providing:

1. **Immediate Relief**: Four evidence-based grounding exercises accessible anytime
